<h1> Burger</h1>
<p>A Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM</p>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.</p>
<p>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.</p>
<p>Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.</p>
<p>Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.</p>
